# Spec Initialization: Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Date:** 2025-11-09

## User's Initial Description

"I want you to review the current state of the project and implement comprehensive testing suite for this project and implement tests where appropriate. The implementer agent seems to be skipping this."

## Context

User has identified a gap in testing coverage for the project. The implementer agent has not been consistently creating tests, and the project needs a comprehensive testing strategy implemented across all layers (unit, integration, and E2E).

## Next Steps

Requirements research agent will:

1. Analyze the current project structure and existing tests
2. Review the tech stack (Vitest, Playwright, Storybook)
3. Identify gaps in testing coverage
4. Gather requirements for testing standards and priorities
5. Determine which areas need testing first
