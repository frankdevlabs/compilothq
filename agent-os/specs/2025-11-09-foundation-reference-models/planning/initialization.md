# Foundation Reference Models & Seed Data

**Priority:** M

## Raw Idea

Implement core reference data models (Country, DataNature, ProcessingAct, TransferMechanism, RecipientCategories) in Prisma schema, create migrations, test in development environment, and implement comprehensive seed data covering 250+ countries with GDPR classifications, 28 data nature types, 17 processing operations, and 13 recipient categories to provide the foundation for automatic compliance validation and classification throughout the platform.

## Key Components

- Country model with GDPR classifications
- DataNature model (28 types)
- ProcessingAct model (17 operations)
- TransferMechanism model
- RecipientCategories model (13 categories)
- Comprehensive seed data for all reference models
- Database migrations
- Development environment testing

## Goal

Create the foundational reference data layer that will enable automatic compliance validation and classification throughout the platform.
