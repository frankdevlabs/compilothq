# Raw Idea

## Feature Description

2b. Package-Based Architecture Migration — Extract existing app logic into reusable packages: specifically migrate UI components and utilities to @compilothq/ui, move database connection and helpers to @compilothq/database, extract validation schemas to @compilothq/validation, update all imports in web app to use packages, configure hot-reloading across packages, and validate development workflow works end-to-end. Validate which other logic can be moved into new packages.
