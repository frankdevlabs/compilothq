name: Global Conventions
description: Follow general development conventions including consistent project structure, environment configuration, dependency management, version control best practices, clear commit messages, and documentation standards. Use this skill when organizing project files and directories, managing dependencies and package files, configuring environment variables, writing commit messages, creating README or documentation files, setting up project configuration, or establishing development workflows. This skill applies when using environment variables instead of hardcoding configuration, never committing secrets or API keys to version control, keeping dependencies minimal and up-to-date, organizing files in predictable directory structures, writing clear commit messages and pull request descriptions, maintaining README files with setup instructions, documenting major dependencies and their purposes, using feature flags for incomplete features, maintaining changelogs or release notes. Use this when organizing files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily, maintaining up-to-date README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines, using clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions, using environment variables for configuration and never committing secrets or API keys to version control, keeping dependencies up-to-date and minimal and documenting why major dependencies are used, establishing a consistent code review process with clear expectations, defining what level of testing is required before merging, using feature flags for incomplete features rather than long-lived feature branches, and keeping a changelog or release notes to track significant changes.

# Global Conventions

## When to use this skill:

- When organizing or restructuring project files and directories for better navigation
- When managing dependencies in package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, or similar files
- When configuring environment variables and ensuring secrets are not committed to version control
- When writing commit messages that clearly describe changes and their purpose
- When creating or updating README files, setup instructions, or contribution guidelines
- When establishing or following project structure conventions (src/, lib/, config/, etc.)
- When adding or updating major dependencies and documenting why they're used
- When using feature flags to manage incomplete features instead of long-lived branches
- When maintaining changelogs or release notes for tracking significant changes
- When setting up or following code review processes and expectations
- When defining testing requirements before merging code
- When configuring project settings using environment variables rather than hardcoded values
- When ensuring API keys, secrets, and credentials are never committed to repositories
- When organizing files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- When maintaining up-to-date README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
- When using clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions
- When using environment variables for configuration and never committing secrets or API keys to version control
- When keeping dependencies up-to-date and minimal and documenting why major dependencies are used
- When establishing a consistent code review process with clear expectations for reviewers and authors
- When defining what level of testing is required before merging (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- When using feature flags for incomplete features rather than long-lived feature branches
- When keeping a changelog or release notes to track significant changes and improvements

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global conventions.
