name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Implement accessible user interfaces using semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, proper color contrast, ARIA attributes, alt text, and focus management to ensure all users can interact with the application. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI components, forms, interactive elements, navigation menus, modals, dialogs, buttons, links, images, or any frontend HTML/JSX/template files. This skill applies when adding ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-describedby, role), ensuring keyboard accessibility with tab navigation and focus indicators, providing alt text for images, implementing proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6), managing focus for modals and dynamic content, ensuring sufficient color contrast ratios, testing with screen readers, or working on any user-facing interface elements. Use this when using appropriate semantic HTML elements (nav, main, button, header, footer, article, section) that convey meaning to assistive technologies, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators, maintaining sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text), not relying solely on color to convey information, providing descriptive alt text for images and meaningful labels for all form inputs, testing with screen readers to verify accessibility, using ARIA attributes to enhance complex components when semantic HTML isn't sufficient, using heading levels (h1-h6) in proper order to create a clear document outline, and managing focus appropriately in dynamic content, modals, and single-page applications.

# Frontend Accessibility

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or modifying React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or any frontend UI components
- When working on HTML, JSX, or template files that render user interfaces
- When implementing interactive elements like buttons, links, forms, modals, dialogs, or dropdowns
- When adding images that need descriptive alt text
- When ensuring keyboard navigation works properly with tab order and focus management
- When using ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-describedby, role, aria-hidden) for complex components
- When implementing proper semantic HTML elements (nav, main, header, footer, article, section, button)
- When ensuring color contrast meets WCAG standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- When managing focus in single-page applications, modals, or dynamically loaded content
- When creating logical heading structures with proper h1-h6 hierarchy
- When testing interfaces with screen readers or accessibility tools
- When designing forms with proper labels and error messages for all inputs
- When using appropriate semantic HTML elements that convey meaning to assistive technologies (e.g., `<button>` instead of `<div>` for clickable elements)
- When ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using only a keyboard
- When maintaining sufficient color contrast and not relying solely on color to convey information
- When providing descriptive alt text for all meaningful images (and empty alt="" for decorative images)
- When testing with screen readers to verify all views are accessible
- When using ARIA attributes only when semantic HTML isn't sufficient for complex components
- When ensuring headings are used in proper order (h1, then h2, then h3, etc.) to create a clear document structure
- When managing focus appropriately when opening modals, showing dynamic content, or navigating in single-page applications

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend accessibility.
