name: Frontend Responsive
description: Implement responsive designs using mobile-first development, standard breakpoints, fluid layouts, relative units, touch-friendly design, and content prioritization across all screen sizes. Use this skill when creating or modifying responsive layouts, media queries, breakpoint-specific styles, mobile navigation patterns, or any UI that needs to adapt to different screen sizes. This skill applies when implementing mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement, defining media queries for standard breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop), using Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:), creating fluid layouts with percentage-based widths or CSS Grid/Flexbox, using relative units (rem, em) instead of fixed pixels, ensuring touch targets are 44x44px minimum, optimizing images and assets for mobile, testing layouts across multiple device sizes. Use this when starting with mobile layout and progressively enhancing for larger screens, consistently using standard breakpoints across the application, using percentage-based widths and flexible containers that adapt to screen size, preferring rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility, testing UI changes across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) ensuring a balanced user-friendly viewing experience on all, ensuring tap targets are minimum 44x44px for mobile users, optimizing images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens, maintaining readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring zoom, and showing the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions.

- When creating fluid layouts with CSS Grid, Flexbox, or percentage-based widths
- When choosing relative units (rem, em) over fixed pixel values for better scalability
- When designing mobile navigation patterns (hamburger menus, bottom navigation, etc.)
- When ensuring touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px) for mobile users
- When optimizing images and assets for different screen sizes and mobile networks
- When testing UI across multiple device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- When prioritizing content visibility and layout for smaller screens
- When ensuring typography remains readable across all breakpoints without zoom
- When implementing responsive components that change behavior based on screen size
- When starting with mobile layout and progressively enhancing styles for larger screens
- When consistently using standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile: 320px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px)
- When using percentage-based widths and flexible containers (like CSS Grid and Flexbox) that adapt to screen size
- When preferring rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility
- When testing and verifying UI changes across multiple screen sizes ensuring a balanced user-friendly viewing experience on all devices
- When ensuring tap targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users
- When optimizing images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens
- When maintaining readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring users to zoom
- When showing the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions and content prioritization
