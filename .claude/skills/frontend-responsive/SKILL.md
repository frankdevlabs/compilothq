name: Frontend Responsive
description: Implement responsive designs using mobile-first development, standard breakpoints, fluid layouts, relative units, touch-friendly design, and content prioritization across all screen sizes. Use this skill when creating or modifying responsive layouts, writing CSS media queries, implementing breakpoint-specific styles, designing mobile navigation patterns like hamburger menus or bottom navigation, or building any UI components that need to adapt their layout or behavior across different screen sizes and devices. Use this when implementing mobile-first CSS that starts with mobile styles as the base and progressively enhances for larger screens using media queries, defining media queries for standard breakpoints like mobile (320px-767px), tablet (768px-1023px), and desktop (1024px+), using Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes like sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl: to apply styles at different breakpoints, creating fluid layouts using percentage-based widths, CSS Grid with fr units, or Flexbox that automatically adapt to available screen space, using relative units like rem or em instead of fixed pixel values for better scalability and accessibility across different screen sizes and zoom levels, ensuring all interactive elements like buttons and links have touch targets of at least 44x44 pixels for comfortable mobile usage, optimizing images and assets for mobile devices using responsive image techniques like srcset, picture elements, or lazy loading to reduce bandwidth usage, testing layouts and functionality across multiple device sizes (mobile phones, tablets, desktops) to ensure a balanced user-friendly viewing experience on all screen sizes, maintaining readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring users to zoom in, showing the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout and content prioritization decisions, using CSS Grid or Flexbox order property to reorder content for different screen sizes when needed, implementing responsive typography that scales appropriately with viewport size, and creating mobile-specific navigation patterns like collapsible menus, slide-out drawers, or bottom navigation bars for better mobile usability.

# Frontend Responsive

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or modifying responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- When writing media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- When implementing mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- When using Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes like sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:
- When creating fluid layouts with CSS Grid, Flexbox, or percentage-based widths
- When choosing relative units (rem, em) over fixed pixel values for better scalability
- When designing mobile navigation patterns (hamburger menus, bottom navigation, etc.)
- When ensuring touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px) for mobile users
- When optimizing images and assets for different screen sizes and mobile networks
- When testing UI across multiple device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- When prioritizing content visibility and layout for smaller screens
- When ensuring typography remains readable across all breakpoints without zoom
- When implementing responsive components that change behavior based on screen size
- When starting with mobile layout and progressively enhancing styles for larger screens
- When consistently using standard breakpoints across the application (e.g., mobile: 320px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px)
- When using percentage-based widths and flexible containers (like CSS Grid and Flexbox) that adapt to screen size
- When preferring rem/em units over fixed pixels for better scalability and accessibility
- When testing and verifying UI changes across multiple screen sizes ensuring a balanced user-friendly viewing experience on all devices
- When ensuring tap targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users
- When optimizing images and assets for mobile network conditions and smaller screens
- When maintaining readable font sizes across all breakpoints without requiring users to zoom
- When showing the most important content first on smaller screens through thoughtful layout decisions and content prioritization
