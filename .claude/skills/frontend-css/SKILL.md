name: Frontend CSS
description: Write and structure CSS following the project's methodology (Tailwind, BEM, CSS Modules, utility classes), maintaining design system consistency, avoiding framework style overrides, and minimizing custom CSS. Use this skill when creating or modifying CSS files (.css, .scss, .sass, .less), styled components, CSS Modules, Tailwind utility classes in templates, or any styling code in components. This skill applies when implementing styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes, writing BEM-style class names, creating CSS Modules for scoped styling, defining design tokens for colors/spacing/typography, working with CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion, configuring CSS purging or tree-shaking for production optimization, or ensuring consistent styling patterns across the project. Use this when applying and sticking to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project, working with the framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides, establishing and documenting design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency, leveraging framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden, and optimizing for production with CSS purging or tree-shaking to remove unused styles.

# Frontend CSS

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or modifying CSS files (.css, .scss, .sass, .less)
- When writing Tailwind CSS utility classes in HTML, JSX, or template files
- When implementing CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- When working with BEM methodology for class naming conventions
- When using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, emotion, or Stitches
- When defining or using design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- When ensuring consistency with the project's established CSS methodology
- When avoiding unnecessary overrides of framework or library default styles
- When optimizing CSS for production with purging unused styles or tree-shaking
- When creating reusable utility classes or maintaining a utility-first approach
- When documenting design system guidelines for colors, spacing, or typography
- When refactoring custom CSS to use framework utilities instead
- When applying and sticking to the project's consistent CSS methodology (e.g., Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules) throughout all styling work
- When working with the framework's patterns instead of creating excessive overrides or fighting against default styles
- When establishing and documenting design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) to ensure consistent design across the application
- When leveraging framework utilities and components to reduce the amount of custom CSS that needs to be maintained
- When configuring CSS purging or tree-shaking to remove unused styles and optimize production bundle size
