name: Frontend CSS
description: Write and structure CSS following the project's methodology (Tailwind, BEM, CSS Modules, utility classes), maintaining design system consistency, avoiding framework style overrides, and minimizing custom CSS. Use this skill when creating or modifying CSS files (.css, .scss, .sass, .less), CSS Module files (.module.css, .module.scss), styled-components or emotion files, or when writing Tailwind CSS utility classes in JSX, HTML, or template files. Use this when implementing styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes like flex, grid, text-center, bg-blue-500, p-4, or responsive variants like md:flex, lg:grid-cols-3, writing BEM-style class names following the Block__Element--Modifier convention for structured CSS, creating CSS Modules for component-scoped styling that prevents global namespace pollution, defining and using design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and other design system values to ensure consistency across the application, working with CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, emotion, or Stitches for component-level styling, configuring CSS purging or tree-shaking tools like PurgeCSS to remove unused styles and optimize production bundle size, avoiding unnecessary overrides of framework or library default styles by working with the framework's patterns, establishing a consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind utility-first, BEM, CSS Modules, or CSS-in-JS) and applying it uniformly throughout the project, leveraging framework utilities and pre-built components to reduce the amount of custom CSS that needs to be written and maintained, documenting design system guidelines for color palettes, spacing scales, typography scales, and other design tokens, refactoring custom CSS to use framework utilities when possible for better consistency and maintainability, and ensuring CSS is organized logically within files and follows the project's established conventions.

# Frontend CSS

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or modifying CSS files (.css, .scss, .sass, .less)
- When writing Tailwind CSS utility classes in HTML, JSX, or template files
- When implementing CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- When working with BEM methodology for class naming conventions
- When using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, emotion, or Stitches
- When defining or using design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- When ensuring consistency with the project's established CSS methodology
- When avoiding unnecessary overrides of framework or library default styles
- When optimizing CSS for production with purging unused styles or tree-shaking
- When creating reusable utility classes or maintaining a utility-first approach
- When documenting design system guidelines for colors, spacing, or typography
- When refactoring custom CSS to use framework utilities instead
- When applying and sticking to the project's consistent CSS methodology (e.g., Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules) throughout all styling work
- When working with the framework's patterns instead of creating excessive overrides or fighting against default styles
- When establishing and documenting design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) to ensure consistent design across the application
- When leveraging framework utilities and components to reduce the amount of custom CSS that needs to be maintained
- When configuring CSS purging or tree-shaking to remove unused styles and optimize production bundle size
