name: Global Tech Stack
description: Reference and maintain consistency with the project's technical stack including frameworks, runtimes, languages, frontend libraries, databases, ORMs, testing tools, deployment platforms, and third-party services. Use this skill when making technology choices, adding new dependencies, selecting appropriate tools or libraries, ensuring consistency with existing stack decisions, or when any technical implementation requires knowledge of the project's established technologies. This skill applies when choosing which framework patterns to follow, selecting appropriate libraries that match the existing stack, implementing features using the project's established ORM or database, writing code that aligns with the project's language and runtime, ensuring frontend code uses the correct CSS and component frameworks, setting up testing with the correct test frameworks. Use this when referencing the project's application framework, language/runtime, package manager, JavaScript framework, CSS framework, UI components, database, ORM/query builder, caching solution, test framework, linting/formatting tools, hosting platform, CI/CD configuration, authentication service, email service, monitoring tools, or any other established technology in the project's tech stack to ensure all implementation decisions align with existing technical choices.

# Global Tech Stack

## When to use this skill:

- When making technology choices or selecting libraries that need to align with the existing stack
- When implementing features that should follow established framework patterns (Rails, Django, Next.js, Express, etc.)
- When writing code in the project's primary language and runtime (Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.)
- When adding frontend code that uses the project's JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)
- When applying styles with the project's CSS framework (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, CSS Modules, etc.)
- When working with the project's database and ORM (PostgreSQL with Prisma, MySQL with Sequelize, MongoDB with Mongoose, etc.)
- When writing tests using the project's established test framework (Jest, RSpec, pytest, JUnit, etc.)
- When configuring linting, formatting, or code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, RuboCop, Pylint, etc.)
- When implementing authentication using the project's auth solution (Auth0, Devise, NextAuth, Passport, etc.)
- When integrating with third-party services already used in the project (SendGrid, Sentry, Stripe, etc.)
- When adding dependencies that need to be consistent with the package manager (npm, yarn, pip, bundler, etc.)
- When deploying or configuring infrastructure aligned with hosting platform (AWS, Vercel, Heroku, Railway, etc.)
- When referencing the project's application framework, language/runtime, or package manager to ensure consistency
- When implementing caching using the project's established caching solution (Redis, Memcached, etc.)
- When setting up UI components using the project's component library (shadcn/ui, Material UI, custom library, etc.)
- When configuring CI/CD pipelines aligned with the project's CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)
- When implementing email functionality using the project's email service (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.)
- When adding monitoring or error tracking using the project's monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)
- When ensuring all technical implementation decisions align with the project's established tech stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.
