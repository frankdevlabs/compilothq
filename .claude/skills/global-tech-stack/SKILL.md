name: Global Tech Stack
description: Reference and maintain consistency with the project's technical stack including frameworks, runtimes, languages, frontend libraries, databases, ORMs, testing tools, deployment platforms, and third-party services. Use this skill when making technology choices or selecting libraries that need to align with the existing stack, adding new dependencies to package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency management files, implementing features using the project's established frameworks, ORMs, or databases, writing code in the project's primary language and runtime environment, setting up testing infrastructure with the project's test frameworks, configuring CI/CD pipelines or deployment settings, integrating third-party services that match the project's existing integrations, or ensuring any technical implementation decision aligns with the project's established technologies and architectural patterns. Use this when referencing and following patterns from the project's application framework (Next.js, Rails, Django, Express, Laravel, Spring Boot, etc.), writing code in the project's primary language and runtime (TypeScript/Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, etc.), using the project's package manager for dependencies (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, bundler, composer, cargo, etc.), implementing frontend features with the project's JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.), applying styles using the project's CSS framework or methodology (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.), building UI components with the project's component library (shadcn/ui, Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, custom design system, etc.), working with the project's database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.), querying data using the project's ORM or query builder (Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, ActiveRecord, Mongoose, SQLAlchemy, etc.), implementing caching using the project's caching solution (Redis, Memcached, in-memory cache, etc.), writing tests with the project's test framework (Jest, Vitest, RSpec, pytest, JUnit, Go testing, etc.), following linting and formatting rules using the project's tools (ESLint, Prettier, RuboCop, Pylint, etc.), deploying to the project's hosting platform (Vercel, AWS, Heroku, VPS, DigitalOcean, etc.), configuring CI/CD using the project's platform (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.), implementing authentication with the project's auth solution (NextAuth.js, Auth0, Devise, Passport, etc.), sending emails using the project's email service (Resend, SendGrid, Postmark, AWS SES, etc.), tracking errors and performance using the project's monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, etc.), and ensuring all new integrations, libraries, and technical decisions are consistent with the established tech stack documented in the project.

# Global Tech Stack

## When to use this skill:

- When making technology choices or selecting libraries that need to align with the existing stack
- When implementing features that should follow established framework patterns (Rails, Django, Next.js, Express, etc.)
- When writing code in the project's primary language and runtime (Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.)
- When adding frontend code that uses the project's JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)
- When applying styles with the project's CSS framework (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, CSS Modules, etc.)
- When working with the project's database and ORM (PostgreSQL with Prisma, MySQL with Sequelize, MongoDB with Mongoose, etc.)
- When writing tests using the project's established test framework (Jest, RSpec, pytest, JUnit, etc.)
- When configuring linting, formatting, or code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, RuboCop, Pylint, etc.)
- When implementing authentication using the project's auth solution (Auth0, Devise, NextAuth, Passport, etc.)
- When integrating with third-party services already used in the project (SendGrid, Sentry, Stripe, etc.)
- When adding dependencies that need to be consistent with the package manager (npm, yarn, pip, bundler, etc.)
- When deploying or configuring infrastructure aligned with hosting platform (AWS, Vercel, Heroku, VPS, etc.)
- When referencing the project's application framework, language/runtime, or package manager to ensure consistency
- When implementing caching using the project's established caching solution (Redis, Memcached, etc.)
- When setting up UI components using the project's component library (shadcn/ui, Material UI, custom library, etc.)
- When configuring CI/CD pipelines aligned with the project's CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)
- When implementing email functionality using the project's email service (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.)
- When adding monitoring or error tracking using the project's monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)
- When ensuring all technical implementation decisions align with the project's established tech stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.
