name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain complex logic sections, avoiding comments about temporary changes or fixes, and preferring clear naming and structure over excessive comments. Use this skill when writing or refactoring code in any programming language, adding comments to complex algorithms or business logic, documenting function parameters and return values, or deciding when comments are necessary versus when code should be self-explanatory. This skill applies when writing concise comments for large sections of complex code logic, ensuring comments are evergreen and relevant long-term, removing outdated or change-related comments, preferring clear variable and function names over explanatory comments, documenting non-obvious business rules or algorithms. Use this when writing code that explains itself through clear structure and naming, adding concise minimal comments to explain large sections of code logic, not leaving code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes, ensuring comments are evergreen informational texts that are relevant far into the future, preferring to improve code clarity through better naming rather than adding explanatory comments, and documenting non-obvious business rules, algorithms, edge cases, or important constraints.

# Global Commenting

## When to use this skill:

- When writing or refactoring code in any programming language
- When adding comments to explain complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious code sections
- When documenting function parameters, return values, or expected behavior
- When deciding whether to add a comment or improve code clarity through better naming
- When ensuring code is self-documenting through clear structure and meaningful names
- When writing minimal, concise comments that explain the "why" behind large sections of code
- When removing outdated comments that reference temporary changes or fixes
- When ensuring comments are evergreen and will remain relevant in the future
- When avoiding comments that simply restate what the code does
- When refactoring commented code to be more self-explanatory
- When documenting edge cases, gotchas, or important constraints that aren't obvious from the code
- When writing code that explains itself through clear structure and naming instead of relying on comments
- When adding concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of complex code logic
- When not leaving code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes (e.g., "fixed bug" or "TODO: refactor later")
- When ensuring comments are evergreen informational texts that will remain relevant far into the future
- When preferring to improve code clarity through better variable and function naming rather than adding explanatory comments
- When documenting non-obvious business rules, algorithms, edge cases, or important constraints that cannot be understood from the code alone

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global commenting.
