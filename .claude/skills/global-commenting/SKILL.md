name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain complex logic sections, avoiding comments about temporary changes or fixes, and preferring clear naming and structure over excessive comments. Use this skill when writing or refactoring code in any programming language including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, or others, when adding comments to explain complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious code sections, when documenting function parameters and return values using JSDoc, TypeDoc, docstrings, or similar documentation formats, or when deciding whether to add a comment or improve code clarity through better naming and structure. Use this when writing code that explains itself through clear structure, meaningful variable and function names, and logical organization rather than relying heavily on comments, adding concise, minimal comments only to explain the "why" behind large sections of complex code logic or non-obvious implementation decisions (not the "what" which should be clear from the code itself), not leaving code comments that reference recent or temporary changes, bug fixes, or TODOs (use issue tracking systems instead for temporary items), ensuring all comments are evergreen informational texts that will remain relevant and accurate far into the future as the code evolves, preferring to improve code clarity through better variable and function naming, extracting methods, or refactoring rather than adding explanatory comments to clarify confusing code, documenting non-obvious business rules, complex algorithms, mathematical formulas, edge cases, gotchas, performance considerations, or important constraints that cannot be understood from reading the code alone, removing outdated comments during refactoring to prevent confusion from stale or inaccurate information, using documentation comments like JSDoc, TypeDoc, or Python docstrings for public APIs, exported functions, or library interfaces to explain parameters, return values, and usage examples, and avoiding comments that simply restate what the code obviously does (like "increment i" for i++).

# Global Commenting

## When to use this skill:

- When writing or refactoring code in any programming language
- When adding comments to explain complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious code sections
- When documenting function parameters, return values, or expected behavior
- When deciding whether to add a comment or improve code clarity through better naming
- When ensuring code is self-documenting through clear structure and meaningful names
- When writing minimal, concise comments that explain the "why" behind large sections of code
- When removing outdated comments that reference temporary changes or fixes
- When ensuring comments are evergreen and will remain relevant in the future
- When avoiding comments that simply restate what the code does
- When refactoring commented code to be more self-explanatory
- When documenting edge cases, gotchas, or important constraints that aren't obvious from the code
- When writing code that explains itself through clear structure and naming instead of relying on comments
- When adding concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of complex code logic
- When not leaving code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes (e.g., "fixed bug" or "TODO: refactor later")
- When ensuring comments are evergreen informational texts that will remain relevant far into the future
- When preferring to improve code clarity through better variable and function naming rather than adding explanatory comments
- When documenting non-obvious business rules, algorithms, edge cases, or important constraints that cannot be understood from the code alone

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global commenting.
