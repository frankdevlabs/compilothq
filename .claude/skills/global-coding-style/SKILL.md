name: Global Coding Style
description: Write clean, consistent code following established naming conventions, automated formatting, DRY principles, meaningful variable names, small focused functions, and consistent indentation across all programming languages. Use this skill when writing or refactoring code in any file type (.js, .ts, .py, .rb, .java, .go, etc.), creating new functions or classes, naming variables and files, removing dead or commented-out code, or ensuring code consistency. This skill applies when following naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case), keeping functions small and single-purpose, choosing descriptive names that reveal intent, applying DRY principle to avoid code duplication, removing unused imports or commented code, ensuring consistent indentation and formatting. Use this when establishing and following naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files across the codebase, maintaining consistent code style (indenting, line breaks, etc.) through automated formatting, choosing descriptive names that reveal intent while avoiding abbreviations and single-letter variables except in narrow contexts, keeping functions small and focused on a single task for better readability and testability, using consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and configuring editor/linter to enforce it, deleting unused code, commented-out blocks, and imports rather than leaving them as clutter, avoiding duplication by extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules, and not writing additional code logic to handle backward compatibility unless specifically instructed otherwise.

# Global Coding Style

## When to use this skill:

- When writing or refactoring code in any programming language (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, etc.)
- When creating new functions, classes, variables, or files that need appropriate naming
- When following established naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, snake_case in Python, etc.)
- When ensuring consistent code formatting and indentation throughout the codebase
- When choosing descriptive, meaningful names for variables and functions instead of abbreviations
- When keeping functions small and focused on a single, well-defined task
- When applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to eliminate code duplication
- When extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules
- When removing dead code, unused imports, or commented-out code blocks
- When configuring or following linter and formatter rules (ESLint, Prettier, Pylint, etc.)
- When refactoring code to improve readability and maintainability
- When writing code that does not require backward compatibility unless specifically instructed
- When establishing and following naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files across the codebase
- When maintaining consistent code style (indenting, line breaks, spacing) through automated formatting
- When choosing descriptive names that reveal intent and avoiding abbreviations and single-letter variables except in narrow contexts (like loop counters)
- When keeping functions small and focused on a single task for better readability and testability
- When using consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and configuring editor/linter to enforce it
- When deleting unused code, commented-out blocks, and imports rather than leaving them as clutter
- When avoiding duplication by extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules
- When not writing additional code logic to handle backward compatibility unless specifically instructed otherwise

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.
