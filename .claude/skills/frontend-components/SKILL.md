name: Frontend Components
description: Design and build reusable, composable UI components with single responsibility, clear interfaces, proper encapsulation, and minimal props following component best practices. Use this skill when creating or modifying React components (.jsx, .tsx), Vue components (.vue), Angular components (.component.ts), Svelte components (.svelte), or any frontend component files. This skill applies when designing component props and interfaces, implementing component composition patterns, managing component state locally or lifting it up, breaking down large components into smaller reusable pieces, defining TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes for components, creating component documentation or examples, establishing component naming conventions, or refactoring monolithic components into composable parts. Use this when ensuring each component has one clear purpose and does it well, designing components to be reused across different contexts with configurable props, building complex UIs by combining smaller, simpler components rather than monolithic structures, defining explicit well-documented props with sensible defaults, keeping internal implementation details private and exposing only necessary APIs, using clear descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose, keeping state as local as possible and lifting it up only when needed by multiple components, keeping the number of props manageable (if a component needs many props, consider composition or splitting it), and documenting component usage, props, and examples for easier adoption.

# Frontend Components

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or modifying React components (.jsx, .tsx files)
- When working on Vue components (.vue files) or Angular components (.component.ts files)
- When building Svelte components (.svelte files) or Web Components
- When designing component APIs with clear, well-documented props and sensible defaults
- When implementing component composition by combining smaller components into larger ones
- When ensuring each component has a single, clear responsibility
- When managing component state and deciding whether to keep it local or lift it up
- When defining TypeScript interfaces, PropTypes, or type definitions for component props
- When refactoring large, monolithic components into smaller, reusable pieces
- When creating documentation or usage examples for components
- When establishing or following component naming conventions
- When building reusable components for component libraries or design systems
- When keeping component implementation details private and exposing only necessary APIs
- When ensuring each component does one thing well instead of handling multiple responsibilities
- When designing components to be reused across different contexts by making them configurable through props
- When building complex UIs by combining smaller, simpler components instead of creating monolithic structures
- When defining explicit, well-documented props with sensible default values
- When keeping internal implementation details private and only exposing necessary props and methods
- When using clear, descriptive component names that indicate their purpose (e.g., `UserProfileCard`, `PrimaryButton`)
- When keeping component state as local as possible and only lifting it up when multiple components need to share it
- When a component has many props and you need to consider using composition or splitting it into smaller components
- When documenting component usage, props, and providing usage examples for team adoption

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.
