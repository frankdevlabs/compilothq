## App components vs. package components

- Rule: If it's reusable UI the component should be in package/ui.
- Rule: If it's a app-specific component it should be located in the apps/web/src/app/components directory
- Rule: If it's a component specific to a specific page it should be located in the apps/web/src/app/[page-name]/components directory.
